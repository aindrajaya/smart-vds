# smart-vds
Vulnerability Detection Scanner for Smart Contracts

### Install
This project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and npm. Node.js source includes npm version.
1. Install **node** and **npm** locally
2. Clone repository. `git clone <git repository>`
    -   I suggest setting up an ssh key as its easier to (clone/push/pull) in git but https works as well.
3. Should be prompted to install `node_modules` on your local but if not run `npm install` for dependencies

### Run Test Node Server
Run `node app.js`
Hosted on: http://localhost:3000/
